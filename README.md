# `Hello World App` â€” AngularJS application

The app contains a sample AngularJS application that says "Hello World!"

The app doesn't do much, shows how to wire a controller & view together using simple routing and displays "Hello World!" message to the user.

The app contains unit tests and end-to-end tests which are written in Jasmine. They are run by Karma and Protractor test runners respectively.
